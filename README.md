# Java Poster Generator

**Java Poster Generator** is an innovative Java application that allows users to quickly generate different types of educational posters using AWT and Swing. It includes predefined layouts for **Informative Posters**, **Concept Maps**, **Do’s & Don’ts**, and **Step-by-Step Guides**.

The application provides a **preview** of each poster type and allows users to customize the design by selecting from **5 different color palettes**.

## Key Features
- **Predefined Layouts** for multiple poster types.
- **5 Color Palettes** for easy design customization.
- **Preview Functionality** for viewing the poster before final adjustments.
- **Quick Poster Design** that reduces the time spent on editing and formatting.
- Integration with **Canva** for further customization (e.g., adding images).

## Use Case
The **Java Poster Generator** simplifies the poster design process. By entering the necessary text, users can quickly create an informative poster layout. Once the layout is generated, the poster can be further customized using **Canva** to add dynamic images, making it ready for use.

The other poster designs (Concept Maps, Do’s & Don’ts, Step-by-Step Guides) can either be used independently or integrated into a more complex design as needed.

## Prerequisites
To understand the code or make structural changes (e.g., adjusting font, box height, etc.), basic knowledge of **Java** is recommended. Users should also be familiar with how to modify properties within the Java code, such as layout, fonts, and colors.

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., **IntelliJ IDEA**, **Eclipse**, **BlueJ**).
2. Compile and run the `PosterGeneratorApp.java` file.
3. Select the poster type, choose the color palette, and input the necessary information.
